Gingerbread Men Invaders

This is a 3D game in which invading gingerbread men descend to conquer
the Earth. The object is to shoot them with cannonballs before
they touch ground to prevent the invasion. It is loosely based on the
Space Invaders 2D game.

This is also a multi-player game. The players cooperate to fend off
the invasion. Each keeps a score of how many gingerbread men he destroys.

To build, the Wild Magic 5 Game Engine is required. This can be
obtained from www.geometrictools.com. It also requires the FMOD sound
system, available at www.fmod.org.

MS VC++ .NET 2010 solution files are provided for Windows, and a
