Scorched Mars

This is a 3D game in which floating cannons situated on a "Martian"
terrain vie to hit and destroy each other with gravity-affected
cannon balls. It is loosely based on the Scorched Earth 2D game.

There are two modes: single-player and multi-player. Multi-player
must be compiled with the NETWORK pre-processor flag defined. In 
single-player mode, enemy cannons are run autonomously.

To build, the Wild Magic 5 Game Engine is required. This can be
obtained from www.geometrictools.com. It also requires the FMOD sound
system, available at www.fmod.org.

MS VC++ .NET 2010 solution files are provided for Windows, and a
makefile is provided for UNIX.
